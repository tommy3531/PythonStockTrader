# Basic Terms
1. Call Options -
2. Put Options -
3. Open - Price of one share when the stock market opens
4. High - Highest value of stock throughout the day
5. Low - Lowest value of stock throughout the day

# Categories of Machine Learning Algorithms
1. Supervised - You go to war and dont stop until all enemies are destoryed
    - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
2. unsupervised - Look at your strength and weaknesses and decide if it fesible to fight
    - k-means, apriori
3. Reinforcement - You have entered the fight and accessing your position. Are you losing men? And you act according
    - markov decision process

# Machine Learning Algorithms
1. Dataset - View as your opponent
2. Linear Regression - completely taking over your opposition, the point of no return
3. Logistic Regression - taking simplistic assumptions and then deciding whether to fight or not
4. Tree Based Modeling - Divide and Rule, you divide your opponents with smart strategy and take them over
5. Bayesian Modeling - probability of winning in different battle base types such as air, land and sea, act accordingly based off the information
6. Support Vector Machines - Drawing out territory and boundary where your advantage on field base. Soldiers might be adept to fighting in a specific area.
7. k nearest neighbor - checking past outcomes and mapping accordingly, evaluate your performance in past battles, contemplate on your weak and strong areas and prepare for the next fight
8. k-means - Building up alliances with provinces which share the same philosophy, goals and motvies, trying to be more powerful then ever before
9. Neural Network and Preceptrons - Every soldier in your army decides whom to fight
10. Ensemble Model -
11. Anomaly Detection - checking for unusual patterns in your own army.  You might have secret agent amongst your team
